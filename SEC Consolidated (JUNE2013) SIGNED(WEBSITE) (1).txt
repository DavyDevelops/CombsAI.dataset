                      RULES AND REGULATIONS, 2013

Introduction

In order to effectively and efficiently carry out the objectives of securities regulation as embedded in
the Investments and Securities Act (The Act), the Securities and Exchange Commission (The
Commission), has prescribed these Rules and Regulations.

These Rules and Regulations provide participants (regulated persons) in the capital market with more
precise notice of what is expected of them, what conduct will be sanctioned and also promotes
fairness and equality of treatment among similarly situated persons.

The Commission recognizes that adoption of formal rule-making process is more efficient than case-
by-case adjudication, because it can resolve a multiplicity of issues in a single proceeding. A clear
general rule can produce rapid and uniform compliance among the affected firms or individuals and
provides individuals with more protection.

The Act has granted the Commission general and specific rule-making authority. However, the
Commission in exercising this authority has adopted a consultative procedure whereby inputs and
comments are obtained from persons subject to its jurisdiction.

The present Rules and Regulations were subjected to comments from market operators and other
participants before its final adoption by the Commission.

These Rules and Regulations are made up of Fourteen (14) parts i.e. A to N and have eleven (11)
schedules. They contain both rules of general and specific applications governing securities
exchanges; capital market operators; securities offered for sale or subscription; mergers, acquisitions
and combinations; collective investment schemes; borrowing by Federal, States, local Government
and other Government agencies as well as Supra national bodies amongst other things.

It should be noted that rule-making is a continuous process. In addition to these legislative or
substantive rules, which may be amended from time to time, the Commission will also be issuing
interpretative rules and general statements of policy all of which guide participants in the market.

Every person subject to the Act is therefore advised to be familiar with both the provisions of the Act
and all the Rules of the Commission regulating the capital market.

In the case of any doubt or need for clarification, the Commission should be consulted.

Pursuant to the provision of Section 313 and all other powers conferred upon it under the Investments
and Securities Act (ISA) of 2007, the Commission hereby makes the following Rules and Regulations.

                   maintenance call will be issued for the difference between the approved maintenance
                   equity level and the current equity level. When a maintenance call is made the call

                  control over those policies. Shareholders beneficially owning a 10% interest

        documentation on a timely basis.

      2. Event of default

        The trust deed for issuance of sukuk shall provide that the occurrence of an event of default
        would entitle the sukuk holders to declare the sukuk immediately due and payable without any

        appropriate.

valued generally at the last known price dealt on the market on which the securities are traded on or
before the day preceding the relevant date of valuation and unlisted securities (other than equities), for
which there is no ascertainable market value, will be valued at cost plus interest (if any) accrued from
purchase to (but excluding) the Valuation Date plus or minus the premium or discount (if any) from
par value written off over the life of the security. Any value otherwise than in Nigeria Naira shall be
converted at the prevailing market exchange rate.

2. If, between the date of the most recent financial statements being used to calculate the turnover of a
firm, and the date on which that calculation is being made, the firm has acquired any subsidiary
company, associated company or joint venture, asset, shares or any other interest not shown on those
financial statements OR divested itself of any subsidiary company, associated company, joint venture,
assets, shares or any other interest shown on those financial statements;

         included in the turnover of the firm;

         (b) the turnover generated by those recently divested assets in the immediately previous
         financial year may be deducted from the firm's turnover if this was included in the turnover
         of the firm.

3. If the financial statements used as a basis for calculating turnover or the turnover included in terms
of sub item (2) are for more or less than 12 months, the values recorded on those statements must be
pro-rated or extrapolated to the equivalent of 12 months.

                                     SCHEDULE IX

                   Code of Conduct for Capital Market Operators and their Employees

PREAMBLE:

   The Nigerian capital market has experienced considerable growth and development in recent years.
The number and range of Issuing Houses and Stockbrokers have expanded significantly. Similarly,
there has been considerable growth in the number of other market operators such as Registrars,
Trustees and Financial Advisers. A natural consequence of this growth has been the increased
complexity of transactions. In such an environment, there is a paramount need to ensure that high
standards are maintained in order to protect the integrity of the capital market. In essence, this code of
ethics is necessitated by the need to ensure discipline, enhance professionalism, integrity and protect
the interest of clients of market operators and indeed the reputation of their institutions. It should be
borne in mind that the unethical activities of one member of a registered institution could jeopardize
the reputation of the entire institution and the securities market. The following code of ethics is merely
a guide as each institution is free to add to it, in line with observed practices.

Definitions:

                                                                                                       

                                                                                                    400

SEC or Commission  ­                Securities and Exchange Commission;

APC                ­                Administrative Proceedings Committee of SEC;

Operators/Registered Institution ­  All capital market operators and Individuals registered
                                    with the Securities and Exchange Commission;

His                ­ Refers to both genders;

Director           ­ Refers to Executive or non-Executive Directors.

Scope:

All operators and their employees are bound by this code. When in doubt about any of the provisions
of this code, clarification should be sought from the S.E.C.

Persons having business interest with these institutions such as auditors, accountants, lawyers etc.,
who in the course of such business relationship might have access to price-sensitive, non-public
information about clients of registered institutions, must enter into an undertaking (oath of secrecy) to
keep such information confidential.

It is obligatory for employees to bring to the notice of management, suspected breaches of the
securities laws or other unethical behavior by other employees. Such reports should be treated in strict
confidence. In essence, the identity of the reporting officer must under no circumstance be disclosed
to other members of staff.

1. CODE OF CONDUCT FOR CAPITAL MARKET OPERATORS (INSTITUTIONS)

   All Operators

        (i) Shall strictly abide, at all times, by all existing Securities Laws, Rules and
                 Regulations made thereunder;

                 relevant SRO or other organisation established for the resolution of dispute between
                 members. If this body is not able to settle a dispute to the satisfaction of the parties
                 involved, such dispute will then be referred to the Administrative Proceedings
                 Committee of SEC. Under normal circumstances, it is only where the APC is also
                 unable to resolve such dispute to the satisfaction of all the parties involved that a
                 court action can be instituted in respect of such dispute;

        (iii) shall not engage in any act that would adversely affect the general investing public's
                 image of, and confidence in, the capital market;

                                                                      401

         spouses, dependent children and relatives;

         that the Commission may from time to time specify;

(x) shall not recommend or connive in the employment of any person who has been
         employed by another operator and has had his employment terminated or who was
         dismissed for reasons relating to fraud, dishonesty or any such dishonourable
         behavior, or who has been convicted of an offence involving same;

(xi) shall communicate to the S.E.C. and SROs the names of staff dismissed for any
         fraudulent act, dishonesty, misbehavior or, any other acts of misconduct;

(xii) may pay or be paid for services provided free of charge with respect to financial
         products and services. For example, research material may be provided to investment
         companies in return for commission income from securities trading orders. However,
         in such cases the volume/amount of financial products and services must be
         reasonable and commensurate with the services provided; and

(ii) not engage in any act that would adversely affect the general investing public's
         image of, and confidence in, the capital market;

(iii) not discriminate or give preferential treatment to any client, in the conduct of his
         professional business;

(iv) comply with all existing securities laws, rules and regulations thereunder.

Disclosure of Information by Employees

(1) To prevent possible conflict of interest, insider dealings and impropriety, an
         employee must disclose to his employer, transaction in securities by himself, spouse,
         dependent children and relatives;

                                                                                                

                                                                                             402  

                   SEC Rules; June 2013  
                                                                                                            

(2) Periodically, (as may be determined by the institution) employees must submit to
         management, statement of their personal securities investment portfolio in the
         securities market;

(3) All new employees must at the time of assumption of duty lodge details of their
         holdings in long term securities of government and public companies with their
         employers;

(4) Although employees may be allowed to invest in securities of private companies,
         such investment shall be disclosed to the employer when the affected company is
         about going public.

Avoidance of Conflict of Interest

An employee shall ensure that his personal interest does not at any time conflict with his duty to his
employer's clients. In this regard, all personal interests beneficial or not, in any company assigned to
him must be disclosed to his employer. He must also ensure that his advice to clients or his employer
on investment decision on behalf of clients is not beclouded by any conflict of interest which might
exist. In other words, in the performance of his duty, his client's best interest must be given priority
over his personal interest.

An employee shall not engage in any activity which might directly or indirectly influence his
judgment prior to or during a business transaction.

Trading with Insider Information

An employee shall not trade in securities either for himself or on behalf of others based on non-public
price-sensitive information. Such information shall under no circumstance be disclosed to a third party
for the purpose of trading. Employees of Broker/Dealer firms must pay particular attention to
substantial orders from clients in companies in which such clients are directors, employees, or have
business relationship, e.g. auditors, reporting accountants and lawyers. Furthermore, all orders which
are out of tune with established trading pattern should be investigated.

All suspected cases of insider dealings including those involving employees should be promptly
brought to the notice of management which should in turn lodge a formal report with the S.E.C. for
necessary action.

Market Manipulation

An employee must not on his own or in connivance with others engage in activities aimed at
manipulating the market. Unverified information which might impact on the market must not be
circulated or form the basis of advice to clients.

Staff Employment

An employee shall not recommend or connive in the employment of any person who has been
employed by another operator and has had his employment terminated or who was dismissed for
reasons relating to fraud, dishonesty or any such dishonourable behaviour, or who has been convicted
of any offence involving same.

                                                                                                    403

         b. act as trustee or executor for clients;

INTRODUCTION

It is generally agreed that weak corporate governance has been responsible for some recent corporate
failures in Nigeria. In order to improve corporate governance, the Securities and Exchange
Commission, in September 2008, inaugurated a National Committee chaired by Mr. M. B. Mahmoud
for the Review of the 2003 Code of Corporate Governance for Public Companies in Nigeria to address
its weaknesses and to improve the mechanism for its enforceability. In particular, the Committee was
given the mandate to identify weaknesses in, and constraints to, good corporate governance, and to
examine and recommend ways of effecting greater compliance and to advise on other issues that are
relevant to promoting good corporate governance practices by public companies in Nigeria, and for
aligning it with international best practices.

The Board of SEC therefore believes that this new code of corporate governance will ensure the
highest standards of transparency, accountability and good corporate governance, without unduly
inhibiting enterprise and innovation.

Whilst the Code is limited to public companies, the Commission would like to encourage other
companies not covered by the Code to use the principles set out in the Code, where appropriate, to
guide them in the conduct of their affairs.

1. Application of the Code

1.1. The Code of Corporate Governance shall apply to the following entities:

(a) all public companies whose securities are listed on a recognised securities exchange in Nigeria;

(b) all companies seeking to raise funds from the capital market through the issuance of securities or
seeking listing by introduction;

(c) all other public companies;

1.2. The Code shall apply to the entities listed in sub-section 1.1 above in the following manner:

(a) All public companies whose securities are listed on a recognized securities exchange shall comply
with the principles and provisions of this code which should form the basis of the minimum standard
of their corporate behavior;

(b) All companies seeking to raise funds from the capital market, through the issuance of securities or
seeking listing by introduction will be expected to demonstrate sufficient compliance with the
principles and provisions of this code appropriate to their size, circumstances or operating
environment;

1.3. The following shall guide the application of this code:-

(a) The Code is not intended as a rigid set of rules. It is expected to be viewed and understood as a
guide to facilitate sound corporate practices and behavior. The Code should be seen as a dynamic
document defining minimum standards of corporate governance expected particularly of public
companies with listed securities;

(b)The responsibility for ensuring compliance with or observance of the principles and provisions of
this code is primarily with the Board of Directors. However, shareholders, especially institutional
shareholders, are expected to familiarize themselves with the letter and spirit of the code and
encourage or whenever necessary, demand compliance by their companies;

                                      

                                   410  

     SEC Rules; June 2013

         ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING/COMBATING FINANCING OF
TERRORISM (AML/CFT) REGULATIONS FOR CAPITAL MARKET OPERATORS

COMMENCEMENT PREAMBLE

Section 13 (n), (aa) and (dd) of the Investments and Securities Act 2007, empowers the Securities and
Exchange Commission (Commission) to protect the integrity of the securities market against all forms
of abuse, fraudulent and unfair trade practices. Given the prominence Anti­Money
Laundering/Combating Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) issues have assumed in International
financial circle and the risks they pose to the financial market globally and Nigeria in particular, a
comprehensive and stringent provision to fight this menace has become imperative.

Pursuant to the above, the Commission has issued these regulations to guide Capital Market
Operators (CMOs) in the implementation of the Know Your Customer (KYC) and Customer Due
Diligence (CDD) requirements for the Capital market. The regulations have been enriched by the
enabling AML/CFT legislation enacted by Nigeria, using the FATF Recommendations, as a
benchmark and some international best practices documents.

The regulations would not only minimize the risk faced by the Market on laundering the proceeds of
crime but will also provide protection against fraud, reputational and other financial market risks.
Consequently, all Capital Market Operators are required to adopt a risk ­ based approach in the

identification and management of their AML/CFT risk in line with the requirements of these
regulations.

Nigerian Capital Market Operators should note that these AML/CFT regulations have prescribed
sanctions for non-compliance with these regulations and other relevant anti-money laundering laws
and regulations. It is, therefore, in their best interest to ensure compliance at all times consistent with
the prescriptions contained herein.

Capital Market Operators shall not establish a business relationship until all relevant parties to the
relationship have been identified and the nature of the business they intend to conduct ascertained.

to determine whether or not there is an element of money laundering for suspicion.

A. Duty to Obtain Identification Evidence

i. Capital Market Operators shall be satisfied that a prospective client is who he/she claims to
         be.

ii. If the client is acting on behalf of another (the funds are supplied by someone else or the
         investment is to be held in the name of someone else's name) then the Capital Market
         Operator shall verify the identity of both the clients and the agent/trustee unless the client is

      transactions.

a. purpose and reason for opening the account or establishing the relationship;

                                     SEC Rules; June 2013

         kept in the client's file to ensure, as far as practicable, that current clients' information is
         readily accessible to the Money Laundering Compliance Officers (MLCO) or relevant
         regulatory bodies.

iii. Apply Commercial Judgment

a. Capital Market Operators shall take a risk-based approach to the `Know Your
       Customer' requirement and decide the number of times to verify the clients' records
       during the relationship, the identification evidence required and when additional
       checks are necessary;

b. For personal account relationships, all joint-account holders need to be verified. In
       respect of private company or partnership, focus shall be on the principal
       owners/controllers and their identities shall also be verified;

       inherent risks in the business or service.

23. ESTABLISHING IDENTITY

A. Identification Evidence

i. The client's identification process shall not start and end at the point of establishing
         the relationship but continue as far as the business relationship subsists. The process of
         confirming and updating identity and address, and the extent of obtaining additional
         KYC information collected will however differ from one type of Capital Market
         Operator to another.

ii. The general principles for establishing the identity of both legal and natural persons
         and obtaining satisfactory identification evidence set out in these regulations are by no
         means exhaustive.

B. What is Identity?

i. Identity generally means a set of attributes such as names used, date of birth and the
        residential address at which the clients can be located. These are features which can
        uniquely identify a natural or legal person.

ii. In the case of a natural person, the date of birth is required to be obtained as an
         important identifier in support of the name. It is, however, not mandatory to verify the
         date of birth provided by the clients.

                                                                                                  

                                                                                               460  

                                SEC Rules; June 2013  
                                                                                                                              

         iii. Where an international passport/national identity card is taken as evidence of identity,
                  the number, date and place/country of issue (as well as expiring date in the case of
                  international passport) are required to be recorded.

     C. When Must Identity be verified?

          i. Identity shall be verified whenever a business relationship is to be established, on
                  account opening or during one-off transaction or when series of linked transactions
                  take place. "Transaction" in these regulations is defined to include the giving of
                  advice.

         ii. Once identification procedures have been satisfactorily completed and the business
                  relationship established, as long as contact or activity is maintained and records
                  concerning that clients are complete and kept, no further evidence of identity is
                  needed when another transaction or activity is subsequently undertaken.

D. Whose Identity Must Be Verified?

a. Clients - sufficient evidence of the identity must be obtained to ascertain that the client is the
         very person he/she claims to be.

b.. a person acting on behalf of another - The obligation is to obtain sufficient evidence of
         identities of the two persons involved.

c. . There is no obligation to look beyond the client where:

         i. the latter is acting on its own account (rather than for a specific client or group of
                  clients);

         ii. a client is a bank, broker, fund manager or other regulated Capital Market Operator,
                  financial institutions; and

         iii. all the businesses are to be undertaken in the name of a regulated Capital Market
                  Operator or financial institution.

         iv. In other circumstances, unless the client is a regulated Capital Market Operator or
                  financial institution acting as agent on behalf of one or more underlying client within
                  Nigeria, and has given written assurance that it has obtained the recorded-evidence
                  of identity to the required standards, identification evidence shall be verified for:

                  a. the named account holder/person in whose name an

                           who regularly provide instructions); and

                  d. any intermediate parties (e.g. where an account is managed or owned by an
                           intermediary).

                  stock exchange) sufficient evidence of identity and address shall be verified in
                  respect of:

                  a. the principal underlying beneficial owner(s) of the company with 5% interest
                           and above; and

                  b. Those with principal control over the company's assets (e.g. principal
                           controllers/directors).

         viii. Capital Market Operators shall be alert to circumstances that might indicate any
                  significant changes in the nature of the business or its ownership and make enquiries
                  accordingly and to observe the additional provisions for Higher Risk Categories of
                  Clients under AML/CFT Directive in these regulations.

         ix. Trusts ­ Capital Market Operators shall obtain and verify the identity of those
                  providing funds for the Trust. They include the settlor and those who are authorized
                  to invest, transfer funds or make decisions on behalf of the Trust such as the
                  principal trustees and controllers who have power to remove the Trustees.

         x. Savings Schemes and Investments in Third Parties' Names When an investor sets up
                  a savings accounts or a regular savings scheme whereby the funds are supplied by
                  one person for investment in the name of another (such as a spouse or a child), the
                  person who funds the subscription or makes deposits into the savings scheme shall
                  be regarded as the applicant for business for whom identification evidence must be
                  obtained in addition to the legal owner.

          xi. Personal Pension Schemes

         a. Identification evidence must be obtained at the outset for all investors, except
                  personal pensions connected to a policy of insurance taken out by virtue of a
                  contract of employment or pension scheme.

         b. Personal pension advisers are charged with the responsibility of obtaining the
                  identification evidence on behalf of the pension fund provider. Confirmation that
                  identification evidence has been taken shall be given on the transfer of a pension to
                  another provider.

E. Timing of Identification Requirements:-

         i. An acceptable time-span for obtaining satisfactory evidence of identity will be
                  determined by the nature of the business, the geographical location of the parties and
                  whether it is possible to obtain the evidence before commitments are entered into or
                  money changes hands. However, any occasion when business is conducted before

                                      

                                   462  

     SEC Rules; June 2013  
                                                                                                                              

                  satisfactory evidence of identity has been obtained must be exceptional and can only
                  be those circumstances justified with regard to the risk.

          ii. To this end, Capital Market Operators shall:-

                   (a) obtain identification evidence as soon as reasonably practicable after it has
                           contact with a client with a view to agreeing with the client to carry out an
                           initial transaction; or reaching an understanding (whether binding or not) with
                           the client that it may carry out future transactions; and;

                  (b) Where the client does not supply the required information as stipulated in (a)
                           above, the Capital Market Operator shall discontinue any activity it is
                           conducting for the client; and bring to an end any understanding reached with
                           the client.

         iii. Capital Market Operators shall observe the provision in the timing of verification
                  under the AML/CFT Directive of these regulations.

         iv. A Capital Market Operator may however start processing the transaction or
                  application immediately, provided that it:

                  a. promptly takes appropriate steps to obtain identification evidence;

                  b. Does not transfer or pay any money out to a third party until the identification
                           requirements have been satisfied.

         v. The failure or refusal by an applicant to provide satisfactory identification evidence
                  within a reasonable time-frame without adequate explanation may lead to a suspicion
                  that the depositor or investor is engaged in money laundering. The Capital Market
                  Operator shall therefore make Suspicious transaction reports to NFIU based on the
                  information in its possession before the funds involved are returned to the potential
                  client or where they came from.

         vi. Capital Market Operators shall put in place written and consistent policies of closing
                  an account or unwinding a transaction where satisfactory evidence of identity cannot
                  be obtained.

         vii. Capital Market Operators shall respond promptly to inquiries made by other persons
                  relating to the identity of their clients.

F. Cancellation & Cooling-Off Rights

Where an investor exercises cancellation rights or cooling-off rights, the sum invested must be repaid
subject to some deductions, where applicable. Since cancellation/cooling-off rights could offer a
readily available route for laundering money, Capital Market Operators shall be alert to any abnormal
exercise of these rights by an investor or in respect of business introduced through an intermediary. In
the event where abnormal exercise of these rights becomes apparent, the matter shall be treated as
suspicious and reported to NFIU.

G. Redemptions/Surrenders

i. When an investor finally realizes his investment (wholly or partially), if the amount payable
       is US$10,000 or above or its equivalent thereof; or N250, 000 for an individual or N500,000
       for a body corporate, or such other monetary amounts as may, from time to time, be
       stipulated by any applicable money laundering legislation or regulation, the identity of the
       investor must be verified and recorded if it had not been done previously.

ii. In the case of redemption or surrender of an investment (wholly or partially), a Capital
       Market Operator shall take reasonable measures to establish the identity of the investor
       where payment is made to:

         a. the legal owner of the investment by means of a cheque crossed "account payee"; or

         b. a bank account held (solely or jointly) in the name of the legal owner of the
                investment by any electronic means effective for transfer funds.

24. IDENTIFICATION PROCEDURES

 A. General Principles

i. A Capital Market Operator shall ensure that it is dealing with a real person or organization
         (natural, corporate or legal) by obtaining sufficient identification evidence. When reliance is
         being placed on a third party to identify or confirm the identity of an applicant, the overall
         responsibility for obtaining satisfactory identification evidence rests with the account
         holding Capital Market Operator.

ii. The requirement in all cases is to obtain satisfactory evidence that a person of that name lives
         at the address given and that the applicant is that person or that the company has identifiable
         owners and that its representatives can be located at the address provided.

iii. Because no single form of identification can be fully guaranteed as genuine or representing
         correct identity, the identification processes shall be cumulative.

iv. The procedures adopted to verify the identity of private individuals and whether or not
         identification was done face to face or remotely and are required to be stated in the client's
         file. The reasonable steps taken to avoid single, multiple fictitious applications or substitution
         (impersonation) fraud shall be stated by the Capital Market Operator in the client's file.

v. An introduction from a respected client, a person personally known to a Director or
         Manager or a member of staff often provides comfort but must not replace the need for
         identification evidence requirements to be complied with as set out in these regulations.

         Details of the person who initiated and authorized the introduction shall be kept in the client's
         mandate file along with other records. It is therefore mandatory that Directors/Senior
         Managers shall insist on following the prescribed identification procedures for every applicant.

   B. New Business for Existing Clients

   i. When an existing client closes one account and opens another or enters into a new
         agreement to purchase products or services, there is no need to verify the identity or address

                                      

                                   464  

     SEC Rules; June 2013  
                                                                                                                              

         of such a clients unless the name or the address provided does not tally with the information
         in the Capital Market Operator's file. However, procedures shall be put in place to guard
         against impersonation and fraud. The opportunity of opening the new account shall also be
         taken to ask the client to confirm the relevant details and to provide any missing KYC
         information. This is particularly important:

         a. if there was an existing business relationship with the client and identification
                  evidence had not previously been obtained; or

         b. if there had been no recent contact or correspondence with the client within the past
                  three (3) months; or

         c. when a previously dormant account is re -activated.

ii. In the circumstances above, details of the previous account(s) and any identification
         evidence previously obtained or any introduction records shall be linked to the new account-
         records and retained for the prescribed period in accordance with the provision of this
         Regulations.

 C. Certification of Identification Documents

i. In order to guard against the dangers of postal-interception and fraud, prospective client shall
         not be asked to send by post originals of their valuable personal identity documents such as
         international passport, identity card, driving license, etc.

ii. Where there is no face to face contact with the client and documentary evidence is
         required, copies certified by a notary public/court of competent jurisdiction, senior public
         servant or their equivalent in the private sector shall be obtained. The person undertaking the
         certification must be known and capable of being contacted if necessary.

iii. In the case of foreign nationals, the copy of international passport, national identity card or
         documentary evidence of his/her address is required to be certified by:

           a. the embassy, consulate or high commission of the country of issue;

           b. a senior official within the account opening institution;

           c. Notary public/court of competent jurisdiction

iv. Certified copies of identification evidence are to be stamped, dated and signed "original
         sighted by me" by a senior officer of the Capital Market Operator. Capital Market Operators
         shall always ensure that a good production of the photographic evidence of identity is
         obtained. Where this is not possible, a copy of evidence certified as providing a good
         likeness of the applicant could only be acceptable in the interim.

D. Recording Identification Evidence

i. Records of the supporting evidence and methods used to verify identity are required to be
         retained for a minimum period of five years after the account is closed or the business
         relationship ended.

                                      

                                   465  

     SEC Rules; June 2013  
                                                                                                                              

ii. Where the supporting evidence could not be copied at the time it was presented, the
         reference numbers and other relevant details of the identification evidence are required to be
         recorded to enable the documents to be obtained later. Confirmation is required to be
         provided that the original documents were seen by certifying either on the photocopies or on
         the record that the details were taken down as evidence.

  ii. Where checks are made electronically, a record of the actual information obtained or of where
         it can be re-obtained must be retained as part of the identification evidence. Such records will
         make the reproduction of the actual information that would have been obtained before, less
         cumbersome.

E. Concession in respect of Payment Made by Post.

 i. Concession may be granted for product or services (where the money laundering risk is
         considered to be low) in respect of long-term life insurance business or purchase of personal
         investment products. If payment is to be made from an account held in the clients' name (or
         jointly with one or more other persons) at a regulated Capital Market Operator, no further
         evidence of identity is necessary.

 ii. Waiver of additional verification requirements for postal or electronic transactions does not
         apply to the following:-

         a. products or accounts where funds can be transferred to other types of products or
                  accounts which provide cheque or money transfer facilities;

         b. situations where funds can be repaid or transferred to a person other than the original
                  clients;

         c. Investments where the characteristics of the product or account may change
                  subsequently to enable payments to be made to third parties.

 iii. Postal concession is not an exemption from the requirement to obtain satisfactory evidence
         of a client's identity. Payment debited from an account in the client's name shall be capable
         of constituting the required identification evidence in its own right.

 iv. Records are required to be maintained indicating how a transaction arose, including details
         of the Capital Market Operator's branch and account number from which the cheque or
         payment is drawn.

iv. The concession can apply both where an application is made directly to the Capital Market
         Operator and where a payment is passed through a regulated intermediary.

 vi. Investment Funds:

         In circumstances where the balance in an investment funds account is transferred from one
         Funds Manager to another and the value at that time is above US$10,000 or N250,000 for an
         individual and N1 million for a body corporate and identification evidence has neither been

                                      

                                   466  

     SEC Rules; June 2013  
                                                                                                                            

       taken nor confirmation obtained from the original Fund Manager, then such evidence shall
       be obtained at the time of the transfer.
25. ESTABLISHING IDENTITY
   Establishing identity under these regulations is divided into three broad categories:
a. Private individual clients;
b. Quasi corporate clients;
c. Pure corporate clients

 A. Private Individual Clients

General Information:-

i. The following information are to be established and independently validated for all private
         individuals whose identities need to be verified:

          a. The true full name(s) used; and

          b. the permanent home address, including landmarks and postcode, where available.

ii. The information obtained shall provide satisfaction that a person of that name exists at the
         address given and that the applicant is that person. Where an applicant has recently moved
         from a house, the previous address shall be validated.

iii. It is important to obtain the date of birth as it is required by the law enforcement agencies.
         However, the information need not be verified. It is also important for the
         residence/nationality of a client to be ascertained to assist risk assessment procedures.

iv. A risk-based approach shall be adopted when obtaining satisfactory evidence of identity. The
         extent and number of checks can vary depending on the perceived risk of the service or
         business sought and whether the application is made in person or through a remote medium
         such as telephone, post or the internet. The source of funds, how the payment was made, from
         where, and by whom must always be recorded, to provide an audit trail. However, for
         higher risk products, accounts or clients, additional steps shall be taken to ascertain the
         source of wealth/funds.

v. For lower-risk transactions or simple investment products, there is an overriding requirement
         for the Capital Market Operator to satisfy itself as to the identity and address of the client.

1. Private Individuals Resident in Nigeria

The confirmation of name and address is to be established by reference to a number of sources. The
checks shall be undertaken by cross-validation that the applicant exists at the stated address either
through the sighting of actual documentary evidence or by undertaking electronic checks of suitable

                                      

                                   467

databases, or by a combination of the two. The overriding requirement to ensure that the identification
evidence is satisfactory rests with the Capital Market Operator.

a. Documenting Evidence of Identity

i. In order to guard against forged or counterfeit-documents, care shall be taken to ensure that
         documents offered are originals. Copies that are dated and signed `original seen' by a senior
         public servant or equivalent in a reputable private organization could be accepted in the
         interim, pending presentation of the original documents. Hereunder are examples of suitable
         documentary evidence for Nigerian resident private individuals:

(a) Personal Identity Documents

     i. Current International Passport

     ii. Residence Permit issued by the Immigration
             Authorities

     iii. Current Driving Licence issued by the Federal Road Safety Commission
              (FRSC)

     iv. Inland Revenue Tax Clearance Certificate

     v. Birth Certificate/Sworn Declaration of Age

(b) Documentary Evidence of Address

     i. Record of home visit in respect of non-Nigerians

     ii. Confirmation from the electoral register that a person of that name lives at
              that address

     iii. Recent utility bill (e.g. PHCN, NITEL, etc.)

     iv. Current driving licence issued by FRSC

     v. Bank statement or passbook containing current
             address

     vi. Solicitor's letter confirming recent house purchase or search report from the
              Land Registry

     vii. Tenancy Agreement

     ix. Search reports on prospective client's place of employment and residence
             signed by a senior officer of the Capital Market Operator.

ii. Checking of a local or national telephone directory can be used as additional corroborative
        evidence but not as a primary check.

b. Physical Checks on Private Individuals Resident in Nigeria

                                                                                                    

                                                                                                 468

       i. It shall be mandatory for a Capital Market Operator to establish the true identities
                and addresses of its clients and for effective checks to be carried out to guard against
                substitution of identities by client.

       ii. Additional confirmation of the clients' identity and the fact that the application was
                made by the person identified shall be obtained through one or more of the following
                procedures:

                a. a direct mailing of account opening documentation to a named individual at

                         of personal identity information that had been previously provided during the

                nature and level of the business to be conducted and the origin of the funds to be
                used within the relationship are also obtained from the clients.

c. Electronic Checks

       i. As an alternative or supplementary to documentary evidence of identity and address,
                the clients identity, address and other available information may be checked
                electronically by accessing other data-bases or sources. Each source may be used
                separately as an alternative to one or more documentary checks;

       ii. Capital Market Operators shall use a combination of electronic and documentary
                checks to confirm different sources of the same information provided by the clients;

       iii. In respect of electronic checks, confidence as to the reliability of information
                supplied will be established by the cumulative nature of checking across a range of
                sources, preferably covering a period of time or through qualitative checks that
                assess the validity of the information supplied. The number or quality of checks to be
                undertaken will vary depending on the diversity as well as the breadth and depth of
                information available from each source. Verification that the client is the data-
                subject also needs to be conducted within the checking process.

       iv. Some examples of suitable electronic sources of information are as follows:-

                                      

                                   469  

     SEC Rules; June 2013  
                                                                                                 

         a. An electronic search of the Electoral Register (is not to be used as a sole
                  identity and address check);

         b. Access to internal or external account database; and

         c. An electronic search of public records, where available.

v. Capital Market Operator shall put in place internal procedures for the identification
         of socially but financially disadvantage persons.

vi. Where a Capital Market Operator has reasonable grounds to conclude that an
         individual client is not able to produce the detailed evidence of his identity and
         cannot reasonably be expected to do so, the Operator may accept as identification
         evidence a letter or statement from a person in a position of responsibility such as
         solicitors, doctors, ministers of religion and teachers who know the client,
         confirming that the client is who he says he is, and his permanent address.

vii. When a Capital Market Operator has decided to treat a client as "financially
         excluded", it is required to record the reasons for doing so along with the account
         opening documents and returns rendered to the SEC and NFIU quarterly.

viii. where a letter/statement is accepted from a professional person, it shall include a
         telephone number where the person can be contacted for verification. The Capital
         Market Operator shall verify from an independent source the information provided
         by the professional person.

ix. In order to guard against "financial exclusion" and to minimize the use of the
         exception procedure, Capital Market Operators shall include in their internal
       procedures the "alternative documentary evidence of personal identity and address"
         that can be accepted.

x.       Capital Market Operators shall put in place additional monitoring for accounts

         opened under the financial exclusion exception procedures to ensure that such

         accounts are not misused.

2. A. Private Individuals not resident in Nigeria

i. For those prospective clients who are not resident in Nigeria but who make face -to-
         face contact, international passports or national identity cards shall generally be
         available as evidence of the name of the clients.

         Reference numbers, date and country of issue shall be obtained and the information
         recorded in the clients' file as part of the identification evidence.

ii. Capital Market Operators shall obtain separate evidence of the applicant's permanent
         residential address from the best available evidence, preferably from an official
         source. A "P.O. Box number" alone is not accepted as evidence of address. The
         applicant's residential address shall be such that it can be physically located.

iii. Relevant evidence shall be obtained by the Capital Market Operator directly from the
         clients or through a reputable credit or Capital Market Operator in the applicant's

                                                                                                  

                                                                                               470  

                                    SEC Rules; June 2013  
                                                                                                   

     home country or country of residence. However, particular care shall be taken when
     relying on identification evidence provided from other countries. Capital Market
     Operators shall ensure that the client's true identity and current permanent address
     are actually confirmed. In such cases, copies of relevant identity documents shall be
     sought and retained.

iv. Where a foreign national has recently arrived in Nigeria, reference might be made to
         his/her employer, university, evidence of traveling documents, etc. to verify the
         applicant's identity and residential address.

B. Private Individuals not Resident in Nigeria: Supply of Information

i. For a private individual not resident in Nigeria, who wishes to supply documentary
         information by post, telephone or electronic means, a risk-based approach shall be
         taken. The Capital Market Operator shall obtain one separate item of evidence of
         identity in respect of the name of the clients and one separate item for the address.

     a. by way of original documentary evidence supplied by the clients;

     b. by way of a certified copy of the client's passport or national identity card
              and a separate certified document verifying address e.g. a driving licence,
              utility bill, etc; or

     c. through a branch, subsidiary, head office of a correspondent bank.

iii. Where the client does not already have a business relationship with the foreign
         Capital Market Operator that is supplying the information, certified copies of
         relevant underlying documentary evidence must be sought, obtained and retained by
         the institutions.

iv. Where necessary, an additional comfort must be obtained by confirming the clients'
         true name, address and date of birth from a reputable institution in the clients' home
         country.

                                                                                                 471  

                                      SEC Rules; June 2013  
                                                                                                                              

         vi. Occupation, public position held and name of employer;

         from a public authority);

 (c) Contacting the clients by telephone, by letter or e-mail to confirm the information supplied

         From the information provided, Capital Market Operators shall be able to make an initial
         assessment of a client's risk profile. Particular attention needs to be focused on those clients
         identified as having a higher risk profile. Additional inquiries made or information obtained
         in respect of those clients shall include the following:

         (i) Evidence of an individual's permanent address sought through a credit reference
                  agency search, or through independent verification by home visits;

         (ii) Personal reference (i.e. by an existing client of the same institution);

         disadvantaged.

The term institution includes any entity that is not a natural person. In considering the clients
identification guidance for the different types of institutions, particular attention shall be
given to the different levels of risk involved.

i. Corporate Entities

For corporate entities (i.e. corporations and partnerships), the following information shall be
obtained:

         (a) Name of institution;

         (b) Principal place of institution's business operations;

         (c) Mailing address of institution;

         (d) Contact telephone and fax numbers;

                                   473  

     SEC Rules; June 2013  
                                                                                                                              

         The Capital Market Operators shall also take reasonable steps to verify the identity and
         reputation of any agent that opens an account on behalf of corporate clients, if that agent is
         not an officer of the corporate client.

 iii. Corporations/Partnerships

         a. For corporations/partnerships, the principal guidance is to look behind the Operator
                  to identify those who have control over the business and the company's/partnership's
                  assets, including those who have ultimate control.

         b. For corporations, particular attention shall be paid to shareholders, signatories, or
                  others who inject a significant proportion of capital or financial support or otherwise
                  exercise control. Where the owner is another Capital Market Operator or trust, the
                  objective is to undertake reasonable measures to look behind that company or entity
                  and to verify the identity of the principals.

         c. What constitutes control for this purpose will depend on the nature of a company,
                  and may rest in those who are mandated to manage the funds, accounts or
                  investments without requiring further authorization, and who would be in a position
                  to override internal procedures and control mechanisms.

         d. For partnerships, each partner shall be identified and it is also important to identify
                  immediate family members that have ownership control.

         e. Where a company is listed on a recognised securities exchange or is a subsidiary of
                  such a company then the company itself may be considered to be the principal to be
                  identified. However, consideration shall be given to whether there is effective
                  control of a listed company by an individual, small group of individuals or another
                  corporate entity or trust. If this is the case then those controllers shall also be
                  considered to be principals and identified accordingly.

                  identity of the principals in respect of Retirement Benefit Programmes,

ii. A Capital Market Operator shall verify this information by at least one of the
         following:

                  practitioner or chartered Accountant confirming the documents submitted;

         (b) Obtaining prior bank references; and
         (c) Accessing public and private databases or official sources.

iii Retirement Benefit Programmes

Where an occupational pension programme, employee benefit trust or share option plan is
an applicant for an account the trustee and any other person who has control over the
relationship such as the administrator, programme manager, and account signatories shall be
considered as principals and the Capital Market Operator shall take steps to verify their
identities.

iv Mutual/Friendly, Cooperative and Provident Societies

Where these entities are client the principals to be identified shall be considered to be those
persons exercising control or significant influence over the organisation's assets. This often
includes Board members, executives and account signatories.

v Charities, Clubs and Associations

In the case of accounts to be opened for charities, clubs, and societies, the Capital Market
Operators shall take reasonable steps to identify and verify at least two signatories along with
the operator itself. The principals who shall be identified shall be considered to be
those persons exercising control or significant influence over the organization's assets.

This includes members of the governing body or committee, the President, Board members,
the Treasurer, and all signatories.

In all cases, independent verification shall be obtained that the persons involved are true
representatives of the operators.

vi. Trusts and Foundations

When opening an account for a Trust, the Capital Market Operator shall take reasonable steps
to verify the trustees, the settlor (including any persons settling assets into the trust) any
protector, beneficiary and signatories. Beneficiaries shall be identified when they are defined.
In the case of a foundation, steps shall be taken to verify the founder, the managers/directors
and the beneficiaries.

vii. Professional Intermediaries

When a professional intermediary opens a client account on behalf of a single client, that
client must be identified. Professional intermediaries will often open "pooled" accounts on

                                      

                                   475  

     SEC Rules; June 2013  
                                                                                                                              

         behalf of a number of entities. Where funds held by the intermediary are not co-mingled but
         where there are "sub-accounts" which can be attributable to each beneficial owner, all
         beneficial owners of the account held by the intermediary shall be identified. Where the
         funds are co-mingled, the Capital Market Operator shall look through to the beneficial-
         owners. However, there may be circumstances that Capital Market Operator may not look
         beyond the intermediary (e.g. when the intermediary is subject to the same due diligence
         standards in respect of its client base as the Capital Market Operator).

         viii. Where such circumstances apply and an account is opened for an open or closed
         ended investment company (unit trust or limited partnership) also subject to the same due
         diligence standards in respect of its client base as the Capital Market Operator, the following
         shall be considered as principals and the Capital Market Operator shall take steps to identify
         them:-

                  (a) The fund itself;
                  (b) Its directors or any controlling board (where it is a company)
                  (c) Its Trustee (where it is a Unit Trust)
                  (d) Its managing (general) partner (where it is a limited partnership)
                  (e) Account signatories;
                  (f) Any other person who has control over the relationship such as fund

                           administrator or manager.

         (ix) Where other investment vehicles are involved, the same steps shall be taken as in
         above (where it is appropriate to do so). In addition, all reasonable steps shall be taken to
         verify the identity of the beneficial owners of the funds and of those who have control over
         the funds.

         (x) Intermediaries shall be treated as individual clients of the Capital Market Operator
         and the standing of the intermediary shall be separately verified by obtaining the appropriate
         information itemized above.

4. Non Face-to-Face Identification

 i. In view of possible false identities and impersonations that may arise with non-face-to-face
         clients, additional measures/checks shall be undertaken to supplement the documentary or
         electronic evidence.

         These additional measures/checks will apply whether the applicant is resident in Nigeria or
         elsewhere and shall be particularly robust where the applicant is requiring a margin facility
         or other product/service that offers money transmission or third party payments.

ii. Procedures to identify and authenticate the client shall be put in place to ensure that there is
         sufficient evidence either documentary or electronic to confirm his address and personal
         identity and to undertake at least one additional check to guard against impersonation and
         fraud.

iii. The extent of the identification evidence required will depend on the nature and
         characteristics of the product or service and the assessed risk.

                                      

                                   476  

     SEC Rules; June 2013  
                                                                                                             

1. If reliance is being placed on intermediaries to undertake the processing of
         applications on the client behalf, checks shall be undertaken to ensure that the
         intermediary are regulated for money laundering prevention and that the relevant
         identification procedures are applied. In all cases, evidence as to how identity has
         been verified shall be obtained and retained with the account opening records.

2.       Capital Market Operators shall conduct regular monitoring of internet-based

         business/clients. If a significant proportion of the business is operated electronically,

         computerized monitoring systems /solutions that are designed to recognize unusual

         transactions and related patterns of transactions shall be put in place to recognize

         suspicious transactions. AML/CFT compliance officers are required to review these

         solutions, record exemptions and report same quarterly to the SEC and NFIU.

5. Establishing Identity for Refugees and Asylum Seekers

i. A refugee and asylum seeker may require a basic account without being able to provide
    evidence of identity. In such circumstances, authentic references from Ministry of Internal
    Affairs or an appropriate government agency shall be used in conjunction with other readily
    available evidence.

ii. Additional monitoring procedures shall however be undertaken to ensure that the use of the
    account is consistent with the client circumstances and returns rendered quarterly to NFIU.

6. Establishing Identity for Students and Minors

i. When opening accounts for students or other young persons, the normal identification
   procedures set out in these regulations shall be followed as far as possible. Where such
   procedures would not be relevant or do not provide satisfactory identification evidence,
   verification could be obtained:

a. via the home address of the parent(s); or
b. by obtaining confirmation of the applicant's address from his/her institution of

         learning; or
c. by seeking evidence of a tenancy agreement or student accommodation contract.

    ii. Often, an account for a minor will be opened by a family member or guardian. In cases
         where the adult opening the account does not already have an account with the Capital
         Market Operator, the identification evidence for that adult, or of any other person who will
         operate the account shall be obtained in addition to obtaining the birth certificate or passport
         of the child. It shall be noted that this type of account could be open to abuse and therefore
         strict monitoring shall be undertaken, and reports made and rendered quarterly to NFIU.

   iii. For accounts opened through a school-related scheme, the school shall be asked to
         provide the date of birth and permanent address of the pupil and to complete the standard
         account opening documentation on behalf of the pupil.

B. Quasi Corporate Clients

 1. Establishing Identity - Trust, Nominees and Fiduciaries

                                                                                                    

                                                                                                 477  

         SEC Rules; June 2013  
                                                                                                      

a. Trusts, nominee companies and fiduciaries are popular vehicles for criminals
         wishing to avoid the identification procedures and mask the origin of the criminal
         money they wish to launder. The particular characteristics of Trust that attract the
         genuine clients, the anonymity and complexity of structures that they can provide are
         also highly attractive to money launderers;

b. Identification and "Know Your Business" procedures shall be set and managed
         according to the perceived risk, in trust, nominees and fiduciaries accounts;

c. The principal objective for money laundering prevention via trusts, nominees and
         fiduciaries is to verify the identity of the provider of funds such as the settlor, those
         who have control over the funds (the trustees and any controller who have the power
         to remove the trustees). For discretionary or offshore Trust, the nature and purpose of
         the Trust and the original source of funding must be ascertained;

d. Whilst reliance can often be placed on other Capital Market Operators that are to
         undertake the checks or confirm identity, the responsibility to ensure that this is
         undertaken rests with the Capital Market Operator. The underlying evidence of
         identity must be made available to law enforcement agencies in the event of an
         investigation;

e. Identification requirements must be obtained and not waived for any trustee who
         does not have authority to operate an account and cannot give relevant instructions
         concerning the use or transfer of funds.

2. Offshore Trusts

a. Offshore Trusts present a higher money laundering risk and therefore additional
         measures are needed for Special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs) or International Business
         Companies connected to Trusts, particularly when Trusts are set up in offshore
         locations with strict bank secrecy or confidentiality rules. Those created in
         jurisdictions without equivalent money laundering procedures in place shall warrant
         additional enquiries;

b. Unless the client for business is itself a regulated Capital Market Operator, measures
         shall be taken to identify the Trust company or the corporate service provider in line
         with the requirements for professional intermediaries or companies generally;

c. Certified copies of the documentary evidence of identity for the underlying
         principals such as settlors, controllers, etc. on whose behalf the client for business is
         acting, shall also be obtained;

d. For overseas Trusts, nominee and fiduciary accounts, where the client is itself a
         Capital Market Operator that is regulated for money laundering purposes:

     i. reliance can be placed on an introduction or intermediary certificate letter
              stating that evidence of identity exists for all underlying principals and
              confirming that there are no anonymous principals;

     ii. the trustees/nominees shall be asked to state from the outset the capacity in

     which they are operating or making the application;

                                                                                                      

                                                                                                 478  

                    SEC Rules; June 2013  
                                                                                                             

                 iii. documentary evidence of the appointment of the current Trustees shall also
                          be obtained.

        e. Where the underlying evidence is not retained within Nigeria, enquiries shall be
                 made to determine, as far as practicable, that there are no overriding bank secrecy or
                 confidentiality constraints that will restrict access to the documentary evidence of
                 identity, shall it be needed in Nigeria;

        f. Any application to open an account or undertake a transaction on behalf of another
                 without the client identifying their Trust or Nominee capacity shall be regarded as
                 suspicious and shall lead to further enquiries and rendition of reports to SEC and
                 NFIU;

        g. Where a Capital Market Operator in Nigeria is itself the client to an offshore Trust
                 on behalf of its clients, if the corporate Trustees are not regulated, then the Nigerian
                  Capital Market Operator shall undertake the due diligence on the Trust itself;

        h. If the funds have been drawn upon an account that is not under the control of the
                 Trustees, the identity of two of the authorized signatories and their authority to
                 operate the account shall also be verified. When the identities of beneficiaries have
                 not previously been verified, verification shall be undertaken when payments are
                 made to them.

3. Conventional Family and Absolute Nigerian Trusts

   a. In the case of conventional Nigerian Trusts, identification evidence shall be obtained for:

        i. those who have control over the funds (the principal trustees who may include the
                 settlor);

        ii. the providers of the funds (the settlors, except where they are deceased);
        iii. Where the settlor is deceased, written confirmation shall be obtained for the source

                 of funds (grant of probate or copy of the Will or other document creating the Trust).

b. Where a corporate Trustee such as a bank acts jointly with a co-Trustee, any non-regulated
      co -Trustees shall be verified even if the corporate Trustee is covered by an exemption. The
      relevant guidance contained in these regulations for verifying the identity of persons,
      institutions or companies shall be followed;

c. Although a Capital Market Operator may not review any existing Trust, confirmation of the
      settlor and the appointment of any additional Trustees shall be obtained;

d. Copies of any underlying documentary evidence shall be certified as true copies. In addition,
      a check shall be carried out to ensure that any bank account on which the Trustees have
      drawn funds is in their names. Taking a risk based approach, consideration shall be given as
      to whether the identity of any additional authorized signatories to the account shall also be
      verified;

e. It is a normal practice for payment of any trust property to be made to all the Trustees. As a
      matter of practice, some life assurance companies make payments directly to beneficiaries
      on receiving a request from the Trustees. In such circumstances, the payment shall be made

                                      

                                   479  

     SEC Rules; June 2013  
                                                                                                                             

        to the named beneficiary by way of a crossed cheque marked "account payee only" or a bank
        transfer direct to an account in the name of the beneficiary.

4. Receipt and Payment of Funds

        a. Where money is received on behalf of a Trust, reasonable steps shall be taken to
                 ensure that:

                  i. the source of the funds is properly identified; and
                  ii. the nature of the transaction or instruction is understood;

        b. It is also important to ensure that payments are properly authorized in writing by the
                 Trustees.

5. Identification of New Trustees

        Where a Trustee who has been verified is replaced, the identity of the new Trustee shall be
        verified before he/she is allowed to exercise control over the funds.

6. Life Policies Placed in Trust

         Where a life policy is placed in Trust, the client for the policy is also a Trustee and where
         the Trustees have no beneficial interest in the funds, it shall only be necessary to verify the
         identity of the person applying for the policy. The remainder of the Trustees would however
         need to be identified in a situation where policy proceeds were being paid to a third party not
         identified in the trust deed.

7. Powers of Attorney and Third Party Mandates

         i. The authority to deal with assets under a Power of Attorney and Third Party
                  Mandates constitutes a business relationship. Consequently, at the start of the
                  relationship, identification evidence shall be obtained from the holders of powers of
                  attorney and third party mandates in addition to the clients or subsequently on a
                  later appointment of a new attorney, if advised, particularly within one year of the
                  start of the business relationship. New attorney for corporate or Trust business
                  shall always be verified. The most important requirement is for Capital Market
                  Operator to ascertain the reason for the grant of the power of attorney.

         ii. Records of all transactions undertaken in accordance with the Power of Attorney shall
                  be maintained as part of the client's record.

  8. Executorship accounts

 a. When an account is opened for the purpose of winding up the estate of a deceased person,
         the identity of the executor /administrator of the estate shall be verified.

 b. However, identification evidence would not normally be required for the
         executors/administrators when payment is being made from an established bank or mortgage
         institution's account in the deceased's name, solely for the purpose of winding up the estate

                                      

                                   480  

     SEC Rules; June 2013  
                                                                                                                              

         in accordance with the Grant of Probate or Letters of Administration. Similarly, where a life
         policy pays out on death, there shall be no need to obtain identification evidence for the legal
         representatives.

 c. Payments to the underlying named beneficiaries on the instructions of the executor or
         administrator may also be made without additional verification requirements. However, if a
         beneficiary wishes to transact business in his/her own name, then identification evidence shall
         be required.

d. In the event that suspicion is aroused concerning the nature or origin of assets comprising an
         estate that is being wound up, report is required to be rendered to NFIU.

9. Unincorporated Business/Partnerships

a. Where the client is an un-incorporated business or a partnership whose principal
         partners/controllers do not already have a business relationship with the Capital Market
         Operators, identification evidence shall be obtained for the principal beneficial
         owners/controllers. This would also entail identifying one or more signatories in whom
         significant control has been vested by the principal beneficial owners/controllers.

b. Evidence of the trading address of the business or partnership shall be obtained.

c. The nature of the business or partnership shall be ascertained (but not necessarily verified
         from a partnership deed) to ensure that it has a legitimate purpose. Where a formal
         partnership arrangement exists, a mandate from the partnership authorizing the opening of
         an account or undertaking the transaction and conferring authority on those who will
         undertake transactions shall be obtained

C. Pure Corporate Clients

     1. General Principles

         a. Complex organizations and their structures, other corporate and legal entities are the
                  most likely vehicles for money laundering. Those that are privately owned are being
                  fronted by legitimate trading companies. Care shall be taken to verify the legal
                  existence of the client company from official documents or sources and to ensure
                  that persons purporting to act on its behalf are fully authorized.

                  Enquiries shall be made to confirm that the legal person is not merely a "brass-plate
                  company" where the controlling principals cannot be identified.

           b. The identity of a corporate company comprises:-

                  i. registration number;
                  ii. registered corporate name and any trading names used;
                  iii. registered address and any separate principal trading addresses;
                  iv. particulars of directors;
                  v. owners and shareholders; and
                  vi. the nature of the company's business.

                                      

                                   481  

     SEC Rules; June 2013  
                                                                                                                             

        c. The extent of identification measures required to validate this information or the
                 documentary evidence to be obtained depends on the nature of the business or
                 service that the company requires from the Capital Market Operator. A risk-based
                 approach shall be taken. In all cases, information as to the nature of the normal
                 business activities that the company expects to undertake with the Capital Market
                 Operator shall be obtained. Before a business relationship is established, measures
                 shall be taken by way of company search at the Corporate Affairs Commission
                 (CAC) and other commercial enquiries undertaken to check that the clients-
                 company's legal existence has not been or is not in the process of being dissolved,
                 struck off, wound up or terminated.

2. Non Face-to-Face Business

        i. As with the requirements for private individuals, because of the additional risks with
                 non-face-to-face business, additional procedures shall be undertaken to ensure that
                 the client business, company or society exists at the address provided and it is for a
                 legitimate purpose.

        ii. Where the characteristics of the product or service permit, care shall be taken to
                 ensure that relevant evidence is obtained to confirm that any individual representing
                 the company has the necessary authority to do so.

        iii. Where the principal owners, controllers or signatories need to be identified within
                 the relationship, the relevant requirements for the identification of personal clients
                 shall be followed.

 3. Low Risk Corporate Business

    a. Public Quoted Companies

        i. Corporate clients that are listed on the securities exchange are considered to be
                 publicly owned and generally accountable. Consequently, there is no need to verify
                 the identity of the individual shareholders.

        ii. it is not necessary to identify the directors of a quoted company.

        iii. Capital Market Operators shall ensure that the individual officer or employee (past
                 or present) is not using the name of the company or its relationship with the Capital
                 Market Operator for a criminal purpose. The Board Resolution or other authority for
                 any representative to act on behalf of the company in its dealings with the Capital
                 Market Operator shall be obtained to confirm that the individual has the authority to
                 act. Phone calls can be made to the Chief Executive Officer of such a company to
                 intimate him of the application to open the account with the Capital Market Operator.

        iv. No further steps shall be taken to verify identity over and above the usual
                 commercial checks where the applicant company is:

                 a. Listed on a securities exchange; or
                 b. there is independent evidence to show that it is a wholly owned subsidiary or

                          a subsidiary under the control of such a company.

                                      

                                   482  

     SEC Rules; June 2013  
                                                                                                    

v. Due diligence shall be conducted where the account or service required falls within
         the category of higher risk business.

b. Private /Public unquoted Companies

i. Where the client is a private/public unquoted company and none of the principal
         directors or shareholders already have an account with the Capital Market Operator,
         the following documents shall be obtained from an official or recognized
         independent source to verify the business itself:

     a. a copy of the certificate of incorporation/registration, evidence of the
              company's registered address and the list of shareholders and directors;

     b. a search at the Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC) or an enquiry via a
              business information service to obtain the information in (a) above; and

     c. an undertaking from a firm of lawyers or accountants confirming the
              documents submitted to the Capital Market Operator.

ii. Attention shall be paid to the place of origin of the documents and the background
         against which they were produced. If comparable documents cannot be obtained,
         then verification of principal beneficial owners/controllers shall be undertaken.

4. Higher Risk Business Relating to Private/Public unquoted Companies

i. For private/public unquoted Companies undertaking higher risk business (in
         addition to verifying the legal existence of the business) the principal requirement is
         to look behind the corporate entity to identify those who have ultimate control over
         the business and the company's assets. What constitutes significant shareholding or
         control for this purpose will depend on the nature of the company. Identification
         evidence is required to be obtained for those shareholders with interests of 5% or
         more;

ii. The principal control rests with those who are mandated to manage the funds,
         accounts or investments without requiring authorization and who would be in a
         position to override internal procedures and control mechanisms;

iii. Identification evidence shall be obtained for the principal beneficial owner(s) of the
         company and any other person with principal control over the company's assets.
         Where the principal owner is another corporate entity or Trust, the objective is to
         undertake measures that look behind that company or vehicle and verify the identity
         of the beneficial-owner(s) or settlors. When a Capital Market Operator becomes
         aware that the principal-beneficial owners/controllers have changed, they shall
         ensure that the identities of the new ones are verified;

iv. Capital Market Operators shall identify directors who are not principal controllers
         and signatories to an account for risk based approach purpose;

v. where there is suspicion as a result of change in the nature of the business transacted
         or investment account, further checks shall be made to ascertain the reason for the
         changes ;

                                                                                                     

                                                                                                  483  

     SEC Rules; June 2013  
                                                                                                                            

       vi. Particular care shall be taken to ensure that full identification and "Know Your
                Clients" requirements are met if the company is an International Business Company
                (IBC) registered in an offshore jurisdiction.

5. Foreign Capital Market Operator

       i. For foreign Capital Market Operators, the confirmation of existence and regulated
                status shall be checked by one of the following means:

                a. checking with the home country's Securities Market Regulator or
                         relevant supervisory body;

                b. checking with another office, subsidiary or branch in the same country;

                c. checking with the Nigerian regulated correspondent Capital Market
                         Operator of the overseas Operator;

                d. obtaining evidence of its license or authorization to conduct Securities
                         business from the Operator itself;

       ii. In addition to the identity of the Principal Employer, the source of funding shall be
                verified and recorded to ensure that a complete audit trail exists if the employer is
                dissolved or wound up;

       iii. For the Trustees of Occupational Pension Schemes, satisfactory identification
                evidence can be based on the inspection of formal documents concerning the Trust
                which confirm the names of the current Trustees and their addresses for
                correspondence. In addition to the documents, confirming the trust identification can
                be based on extracts from Public Registrars or references from Professional Advisers
                or Investment Managers;

       iv. Any payment of benefits by or on behalf of the Trustees of an Occupational Pension
                Scheme shall require verification of identity of the recipient;

       v. Where individual members of an Occupation Pension Scheme are to be given
                personal investment advice, their identities shall be verified;

       vi. where the Trustees and Principal Employer have been satisfactorily identified (and
                the information is still current) it may be appropriate for the Employer to provide
                confirmation of the identity of individual employees.

6. Other Institutions

    A. Charities in Nigeria

        i. Adherence to the identification procedures required for money laundering prevention
                 purpose would remove the opportunities for opening unauthorized accounts with
                 false identities on behalf of charities. Confirmation of the authority to act in the
                 name of the charity is mandatory.

                                      

                                   484  

     SEC Rules; June 2013  
                                                                                                             

    ii. The practice of opening unauthorized accounts of this type under sole control is
             strongly discouraged. Accounts for charities in Nigeria are required to be operated by
             a minimum of two signatories duly verified and documentation evidence obtained.

    B. Registered Charities

    i. When dealing with an application from a registered charity, the Capital Market
             Operator shall obtain and confirm the name and address of the charity concerned.

    ii. To guard against the laundering of fraudulently obtained funds (where the person
             making the application or undertaking the transaction is not the official
             correspondent or the recorded alternate) a Capital Market Operator is required to
             send a letter to the official correspondence, informing him of the schemes application
             before it. The official correspondence shall be requested to respond as a matter of
             urgency especially where there is any reason to suggest that the application has been
             made without authority.

    iii. Applications on behalf of unregistered charities shall be dealt with in accordance
             with procedures for clubs and societies set out in these rules.

    C. Clubs and Societies

    i. In the case of applications made on behalf of clubs or societies, a Capital Market
             Operator shall take reasonable steps to satisfy itself as to the legitimate purpose of
             the organisation by sighting its constitution. The identity of at least two of the
             principal contact persons or signatories shall be verified initially in line with the
             requirements for private individuals. The signing authorities shall be structured to
             ensure that at least two of the signatories that authorize any transaction has been
             verified. When signatories change, Capital Market Operators shall ensure that the
             identities of at least two of the current signatories are verified.

    ii. Where the purpose of the club or society is to purchase the shares of regulated
             investment company or where all the members would be regarded as individual
             clients, all the members in such cases are required to be identified in line with the
             requirements for personal clients.

    iv. Capital Market Operators are required to look at each situation on a case ­by case
             basis.

D. Occupational Pension Schemes

In all transactions undertaken on behalf of an Occupational Pension Scheme where the transaction is
not in relation to a long term policy of insurance, the identities of both the Principal Employer and the
Trust are required to be verified.

E.  Religious Organizations (ROs)

A religious organisation is expected by law to be registered by the Corporate Affairs Commission
(CAC) and shall therefore have a registered number. Its identity can be verified by reference to the
CAC, appropriate headquarters or regional area of the denomination. As a Registered organisation,
the identity of a least two signatories to its account shall be verified.

                                                                                                        

                                                                                                     485  

                                   SEC Rules; June 2013  
                                                                                                                              

 F. Three-Tiers of Government/Parastatals

Where the client for business is any of the above, the Capital Market Operator shall verify the legal
standing of the applicant, including its principal ownership and the address. A certified copy of the
Resolution or other documents authorizing the opening of the account or to undertake the transaction
shall be obtained in addition to evidence that the official representing the body has the relevant
authority to act. Telephone contacts shall also be made with the Chief Executive Officer of the
organisation/parastatals concerned, intimating him of the application to open the account with the
Capital Market Operator.

G. Foreign Consulates

The authenticity of clients that request to undertake transactions with Capital Market Operators in the
name of Nigerian-resident foreign consulates and any documents of authorization presented in support
of the application shall be checked with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs or the relevant authorities in
the Consulate's home country.

H. Special Surveillance on certain transactions

Where a transaction is frequent and unjustifiable or unreasonable; is surrounded by conditions of
unusual or unjustified complexity; appears to have no economic justification or lawful objective or in
the opinion of the Capital Market Operator involves terrorist financing or is inconsistent with the
known transaction pattern of the account or the business relationship, that transaction shall be deemed
to be suspicious and the Capital Market Operator involved shall seek information from the customer
as to the origin and destination of the funds, the aim of the transaction and the identity of the
beneficiary.

26. INTERMEDIARIES OR OTHER THIRD PARTIES TO VERIFY IDENTITY OR TO
INTRODUCE BUSINESS

 A. Who to rely upon and the circumstances

Whilst the responsibility to obtain satisfactory identification evidence rests with the Capital Market
Operator that is entering into the relationship with a client, it is reasonable, in a number of
circumstances, for reliance to be placed on another Capital Market Operator to:

i. undertake the identification procedure when introducing a clients and to obtain any
         additional KYC information from the client; or

ii. confirm the identification details if the clients is not resident in Nigeria; or

iii. confirm that the verification of identity has been carried out (if an agent is acting for
         underlying principals).

B. Introductions from Authorised Financial Intermediaries

         i. Where an intermediary introduces a client and then withdraws from the ensuing
                  relationship altogether, then the underlying clients has become the applicant for the

                                      

                                   486  

     SEC Rules; June 2013  
                                                                                                                              

                  business. He shall be identified in line with the requirements for personal, corporate
                  or business clients as appropriate.

         ii. An introduction letter shall be issued by the introducing Capital Market Operator or
                  person in respect of each applicant for business. To ensure that product-providers
                  meet their obligations, that satisfactory identification evidence has been obtained and
                  will be retained for the necessary statutory period, each introduction letter shall
                  either be accompanied by certified copies of the identification evidence that has been
                  obtained in line with the usual practice of certification of identification documents or
                  by sufficient details/reference numbers, etc that will permit the actual evidence
                  obtained to be re-obtained at a later stage.

  C. Written Applications

 For a written application (unless other arrangements have been agreed that the service provider will
verify the identity itself) an intermediary shall provide along with each application, the clients'
introduction letter together with certified copies of the evidence of identity which shall be placed in
the clients' file.

  D. Non-Written Application

Unit Trust Managers and other product providers receiving non-written applications from financial
intermediaries (where a deal is placed over the telephone or by other electronic means) have an
obligation to verify the identity of clients and ensure that the intermediary provides specific
confirmation that identity has been verified. A record shall be made of the answers given by the
intermediary and retained for a minimum period of five years.

 E. Introductions from Foreign Intermediaries

Where introduced business is received from a regulated financial intermediary who is outside Nigeria,
the reliance that can be placed on that intermediary to undertake the verification of identity-check
shall be assessed by the Compliance officer or some other competent persons within the Capital
Market Operator on a case by case basis based on the knowledge of the intermediary.

 F. Corporate Group Introductions

         i. Where a client is introduced by one part of a financial sector group to another, it is
                  not necessary for identity to be re-verified or for the records to be duplicated
                  provided that:

                  a. the identity of the clients has been verified by the introducing parent
                           company, branch, subsidiary or associate in line with the money laundering
                           requirements to equivalent standards and taking account of any specific
                           requirements such as separate address verification;

                  b. no exemptions or concessions have been applied in the original verification
                           procedures that would not be available to the new relationship;

                                      

                                   487  

     SEC Rules; June 2013  
                                                                                                                              

                  c. a group introduction letter is obtained and placed with the clients' account
                           opening records; and

                  d. in respect of group introducers from outside Nigeria, arrangements shall be
                           put in place to ensure that identity is verified in accordance with requirements
                           and that the underlying records of identity in respect of introduced clients are
                           retained for the necessary period.

         ii. Where a Capital Market Operator have day-to-day access to all the Group's "Know
                  Your Customer" information and records, there is no need to identify an introduced
                  clients or obtain a group introduction letter if the identity of that clients has been
                  verified previously. However, if the identity of the clients has not previously been
                  verified, then any missing identification evidence will need to be obtained and a risk-
                  based approach taken on the extent of KYC information that is available on whether
                  or not additional information shall be obtained.

         iii. Capital Market Operators shall ensure that there is no secrecy or data protection
                  legislation that would restrict free access to the records on request or by law
                  enforcement agencies under court order or relevant mutual assistance procedures. If
                  it is found that such restrictions apply, copies of the underlying records of identity
                  shall, wherever possible, be sought and retained.

         v. Where identification records are held outside Nigeria, it shall be the responsibility of
                  the Capital Market Operators to ensure that the records available do, in fact, meet the
                  requirements in these regulations.

G. Business Conducted by Agents

         i. Where an applicant is dealing in its own name as agent for its own client, a Capital
                  Market Operator shall, in addition to verifying the agent, establish the identity of the
                  underlying client.

         ii. A Capital Market Operator may regard evidence as sufficient if it has established that
                  the client:

                  a. is bound by and has observed these regulations or the provisions of the Money
                           Laundering (Prohibition) Act, as amended; and

                  b. is acting on behalf of another person and has given a written assurance that
                           he has obtained and recorded evidence of the identity of the person on whose
                           behalf he is acting.

         iii. Consequently, where another Capital Market Operator deals with its own client
                  (regardless of whether or not the underlying client is disclosed to the Capital Market
                  Operator) then:

                  a. where the agent is a Capital Market Operator, there is no requirement to
                           establish the identity of the underlying clients or to obtain any form of written
                           confirmation from the agent concerning the due diligence undertaken on its
                           underlying clients; or

                                      

                                   488  

     SEC Rules; June 2013  
                                                                                                      

     b. where a regulated agent from outside Nigeria deals through a client's
              omnibus account or for a named clients through a designated account, the
              agent shall provide a written assurance that the identity of all the underlying
              clients has been verified in accordance with their local requirements.

     c. Where such an assurance cannot be obtained, then the business shall not be
              undertaken.

     d. In circumstances where an agent is either unregulated or is not covered by the
              relevant money laundering legislation, then each case shall be treated on its
              own merits. The knowledge of the agent will inform the type of the due
              diligence standards to apply.

H. Correspondent Relationship

i. Transactions conducted through correspondent relationships need to be managed,
         taking a risk-based approach. "Know Your Correspondent" procedures are required
         to be established to ascertain whether or not the correspondent Capital Market
         Operator or the counter-party is itself regulated for money laundering prevention. If
         regulated, the correspondent, Capital Market Operator is required to verify the
         identity of its clients in accordance with FATF-standards. Where this is not the case,
         additional due diligence will be required to ascertain and assess the correspondent
         Capital Market Operator internal policy on money laundering prevention and know
         your clients procedures.

ii. The volume and nature of transactions flowing through correspondent accounts with
         Capital Market Operator from high risk jurisdictions or those with inadequacies or
         material deficiencies shall be monitored against expected levels, destinations and any
         material variances shall be checked.

iii. Capital Market Operators shall maintain records of having ensured that sufficient due
         diligence has been undertaken by the remitting bank on the underlying client and the
         origin of the funds in respect of the funds passed through their accounts.

vi. Capital Market Operators shall guard against establishing correspondent
         relationships with high risk foreign banks (e.g. shell banks with no physical presence
         in any country) or with correspondent banks that permit their accounts to be used by
         such banks.

I. Acquisition of One Capital Market Operator/Business by Another

i. When one Capital Market Operator acquires the business and accounts of another
         Capital Market Operator, it is not necessary for the identity of all the existing clients
         to be re-identified, provided that all the underlying clients' records are acquired with
         the business. It is, however, important to carry out due diligence enquiries to confirm
         that the acquired operator had conformed with the requirements in these regulations.

ii. Verification of identity shall be undertaken as soon as it is practicable for all the
         transferred clients who were not verified by the transferor in line with the
         requirements for existing clients that open new accounts, where:-

                                                                                                  

                                                                                               489  

                               SEC Rules; June 2013  
                                                                                                                 

     a. the money laundering procedures previously undertaken have not been in
              accordance with the requirements of these regulations;

     b. the procedures cannot be checked; or
     c. the clients-records are not available to the acquiring Capital Market Operator.

27. RECEIVING CAPITAL MARKET OPERATORS AND AGENTS

A. Vulnerability of Receiving Bankers and Agents to Money Laundering

Receiving Capital Market Operators may be used by money launderers in respect of offers for sale
where new issues are over-subscribed and their allocation is scaled down. In addition, the money
launderer is not concerned if there is a cost involved in laundering criminal money. New issues that
trade at a discount will, therefore, still prove acceptable to the money launderer. Criminal funds can be
laundered by way of the true beneficial-owner of the funds providing the payment for an application
in another person's name, specifically to avoid the verification process and to break the audit trail with
the underlying crime from which the funds are derived.

B. Who shall be identified?

i. Receiving Capital Market Operators shall obtain satisfactory identification evidence
         of new applicants, including such applicants in a rights issue where the value of a
         single transaction or a series of linked transactions is US$10,000 or its equivalent for
         foreign transfers or N250,000 for individuals and N500,0000 for corporate body or
         more.

ii. If funds to be invested are being supplied by or on behalf of a third party, it is
         important that the identification evidence for both the applicant and the provider of
         the funds are obtained to ensure that the audit trail for the funds is preserved.

C. Applications Received via Brokers

i. Where the application is submitted (payment made) by a broker or an intermediary acting as
         agent, no steps need be taken to verify the identity of the underlying applicants. However,
         the following standard procedures apply:

a. The lodging agent's stamp shall be affixed on the application form or allotment
         letter; and

b. Application/acceptance forms and cover letters submitted by lodging agents shall be
         identified and recorded in the Capital Market Operator's records.

ii. The terms and conditions of the issue shall state that any requirements to obtain
         identification evidence are the responsibility of the broker lodging the application and not
         the receiving Capital Market Operator.

iii. Where the original application has been submitted by a regulated broker, no additional
         identification evidence will be necessary for subsequent calls in respect of shares issued and
         partly paid.

D. Applications Received from Foreign Brokers

                                                                                                          

                                                                                                       490  

                                      SEC Rules; June 2013  
                                                                                                          

If the broker or other introducer is a regulated person or institution (including an overseas branch or
subsidiary) from a country with equivalent legislation and financial sector procedures, and the broker
or introducer is subject to anti-money laundering rules or regulations, then a written assurance can be
taken from the broker that he/she has obtained and recorded evidence of identity of any principal and
underlying beneficial owner that is introduced.

E. Multiple Family Applications

  i. Where multiple family applications are received supported by one cheque and the aggregate
         subscription price is US$10,000 or its equivalent for foreign transfers; and N250,000 or more
         for an individual person, then identification evidence will not be required for:

         a. a spouse or any other person whose surname and address are the same as those of the
                  applicant who has signed the cheque;

         b. a joint account holder; or

         c. an application in the name of a child where the relevant company's Articles of
                  Association prohibit the registration in the names of minors and the shares are to be
                  registered with the name of the family member of full age on whose account the
                  cheque is drawn and who has signed the application form.

  ii. However, identification evidence of the signatory of the financial instrument will be
         required for any multiple family application for more than US$10,000 or its equivalent for
         foreign transfers; or more than N250, 000 for an individual; or more than N500, 000 for a
         body corporate where such is supported by a cheque signed by someone whose name differs
         from that of the applicant. Other monetary amounts or more may, from time to time, be
         stipulated by any applicable money laundering legislation/guidelines.

 iii. Where an application is supported by a financial institution's branch cheque or brokers' draft,
         the applicant shall state the name and account number from which the funds were drawn:

                   a. on the front of the cheque; or
                   b. on the back of the cheque together with a branch stamp; or
                   c. providing other supporting documents.

F. Linked Transactions

        i. If it appears to a person handling applications that a number of single applications
                 under US$10,000 and N500, 000 in different names are linked (e.g. payments from
                 the same Capital Market Operator account) apart from the multiple family
                 applications above, identification evidence shall be obtained in respect of parties
                 involved in each single transaction.

        ii. Installment payment issues shall be treated as linked transactions where it is known
                 that total payments will amount to US$10,000 or its equivalent for foreign transfers
                 or N250,000 for an individual; or N500,0000 for body corporate or such other
                 monetary amounts as may, from time to time, be stipulated by any applicable money
                 laundering legislation or guidelines. Either at the outset or when a particular point
                 has been reached, identification evidence shall be obtained.

                                      

                                   491  

     SEC Rules; June 2013  
                                                                                                                              

         iii. Applications that are believed to be linked and money laundering is suspected shall
                  be processed on a separate batch for investigation after allotment and registration has
                  been completed. Returns with the documentary evidence are to be rendered to the
                  NFIU accordingly. Copies of the supporting cheques, application forms and any
                  repayment-cheques shall be retained to provide an audit trail until the receiving
                  Capital Market Operator is informed by NFIU or the investigating officer that the
                  records are of no further interest.

28. EXEMPTION FROM IDENTIFICATION PROCEDURES

Where a client's identity was not properly obtained as contained in these regulations and
Requirements for Account Opening Procedure, Capital Market Operators shall re-establish the
client's identity in line with the contents of these regulations, except where it concerns:

i. Nigerian Capital Market Operators

         Identification evidence is not required where the client for business is a Nigerian Capital
         Market Operator or person covered and regulated by the requirements of these regulations.

ii. One-off Cash Transaction (Remittances, Wire Transfers, etc)

         Cash remittances and wire transfers (either inward or outward) or other monetary instruments
         that are undertaken against payment in cash for clients who do not have an account or other
         established relationship with the Capital Market Operator (i.e. walk ­in clients) present a high
         risk for money laundering purposes. It is therefore required that adequate procedures are
         established to record the transaction and relevant identification evidence taken, where
         necessary. Where such transactions form a regular part of the Capital Market Operator's
         business, the limits for requiring identification evidence of US $10,000 or its equivalent for
         foreign transfers; N250,000 for individual and N500,000 for a corporate body must, however,
         be observed.

 iii. Re-investment of Income

         The proceeds of a one-off transaction can be paid to a client or be further re-invested where
         records of his identification requirements were obtained and kept. In the absence of this
         his/her identification requirements shall be obtained before the proceeds are paid to him or
         be re-invested on his behalf in accordance with the relevant provision of these regulations.

29. SANCTIONS FOR NON-COMPLIANCE WITH THE REGULATIONS

Failure to comply with the provisions contained in these regulations will attract appropriate sanction
in accordance with Money Laundering Act/Combating Financing Terrorism laws and as detailed in
the Anti-Money Laundering Act/Combating Financing Terrorism section of these regulations.
